### Go Native

We would ideally turn this into a native app for android and iphone and offer notifications as preferable to sms's for reminders. 

### Feature Ideas

These were considered in our architecture but were deprioritised due to time constraints

- I can choose to get reminders to request a new prescription before you need it
- I can choose to get reminders to book a doctor review before you need it
- I can see details about my medicine from the NHS

These are other ideas that we deprioritised before we began design

- Link to/details of my pharmacy 
- Link to/details of my GP
- Search conditions to get NHS information
